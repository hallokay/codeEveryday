                        Photoshop 1.0 was officially released in February 1990 and was the first time the software was made available to the public as a standalone product (rather than bundled with a Barneyscan scanner). 
                        It was also the first time the software was released commercially with the brand name Adobe Photoshop.

                        Following the initial success of Adobe Photoshop 1.0, Adobe Photoshop 2.0 was released in June 1991 along with a plethora of new features.

                        One of the most notable new features in Adobe Photoshop 2.0 was the Paths feature. This allowed users of the application to trim around an object and then save that 'path' for use in the future. It was added by the newly appointed engineer, Mark Hamburg.

                        Mark was hired by Adobe to work on the software after the success of the initial release. Previously, Thomas Knoll was the only engineer that worked on the software.

                        Adobe Photoshop 3.0 was released in September 1994 and November 1994 for Mac and Windows respectively. 
                        It was version 3.0 that brought one of the most important Photoshop features ever to the software; Layers.
                        Photoshop 3.0 was also the first version of Photoshop in which the Windows version was on-par with the Mac version of the application. Previously, the Windows version wasn't as stable, as was proven by the memory bug in version 2.5.

                        Adobe Photoshop 4.0 was released in November 1996 and brought two notable features; Actions and Adjustment Layers.
                        Another big change in Adobe Photoshop 4.0 was the unification of the UI with Adobe's other products (e.g. Dreamweaver etc). This ensured that the Photoshop learning-curve was less steep for existing Adobe software users. Adobe has maintained UI consistency in all versions of Photoshop since version 4.0.

                        Adobe Photoshop 5.0 was released in May 1998 for Mac and 
                        Windows simultaneously. It came with a number of new features including Editable Type, 
                        Multiple Undo and Colour Management.
                        Photoshop 5.0 solved this problem with Editable Type. This was a giant leap forward for Photoshop as it allowed type to be edited by designers an unlimited number of times.

                        Photoshop 6.0 was a notable release that included a number of new features including Vector Shapes and the "Liquify" filter. Vector Shapes gave users the ability to simply draw vector shapes and create them into bitmap images. It was a feature that was applauded by Photoshop users.
                        Photoshop 6.0 also saw the introduction of Multi-Layer functions and Blending Options within Layers. This gave users a lot more control and flexibility when it came to blending the various elements of their designs. The Crop tool and Marque tool were also separated in the release of version 6.0 which made it easier to select each of the commonly used tools from the menu bar.

                        Version 7.0 introduced a number of useful features including the Healing Brush. It also introduced an upgrade to text which made all text fully vector. This allowed designers to resize their text with ease without losing any of the quality.
                        A new file system was also added to version 7.0 which allowed designers to find the images they were looking for with increased ease. Graphics that were in a folder could be easily renamed using the Batch Rename feature and engineers added a number of other useful commands that made working with large quantities of images easier than ever.

                        and a whole host of new and exciting features were included.
                        Photoshop CS featured a number of improvements to the Slice Tool, 
                        along with many new filters and commands including the Match Colour command and Lens Blur filter. 
                        Smart Guides were also implemented in Photoshop CS.

                        eighteen months after the release of the original Photoshop CS.
                        Many new features, 
                        filters and tools were introduced in Photoshop CS2. 
                        Due to its popularity, 
                        Adobe brought the Red Eye Removal tool from Adobe Photoshop Elements and incorporated into CS2. 
                        They also introduced the ability to select multiple Layers.

                        Adobe added native support for the new line of Macintosh computers 
                        with Intel processors and improved Windows Vista support too. 
                        Because of this, many users experienced quicker load times and 
                        better performance of the program overall.
                        One new feature that was included in Photoshop CS3 was the graphic optimisation 
                        for mobile devices. With the release of the original iPhone and other Smartphone's in 2007, 
                        many web designers were starting to focus on 
                        mobile-optimised designs so this addition was well-received within the web design community.

                        that were made to panning and zooming. In previous versions of Photoshop, 
                        there was a few seconds lag time whenever zooming and panning but in CS4, 
                        it was almost instant. Combined with fluid canvas rotation, 
                        this allowed users to quickly track down and zoom in on the part of the image 
                        that they wanted to edit.

                        Numerous improvements were made in CS5 and numerous features were added. 
                        One noteworthy feature was Content-aware Fill; 
                        this allowed the application to cleverly fill in the area taking 
                        the content of the image into account. The Puppet Warp tool, 
                        Mixer Brush and Bristle Tips were also added in CS5.

                        the release of the original CS5 software.
                        Adobe CS6 brought a huge number of changes to the Photoshop software 
                        including an entirely redesigned UI. 
                        All of the icons within the application were redesigned and

                        two new blur tools (spin blur and path blur) and 
                        a new focus mask feature that enables the user to select parts of an image 
                        based on whether they are in focus or not.
